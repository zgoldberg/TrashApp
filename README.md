# TrashApp
This app was developed as part of CIS 350 at UPenn

In urban environments, despite anti-littering laws, there is an abundance of trash everywhere. There seems to be almost no social obligation felt by people living in cities to keep their neighborhoods clean. Often when you see someone littering, there is no record and they quickly disappear into the crowd.

On the contrary, some people are very environmentally conscious and take great care in recycling and even cleaning up other peopleâ€™s litter. These people often go unnoticed and others cannot learn from their examples.

Our proposed system is a social media/public shaming app that allows users to post instances of witnessed accounts of public littering, as well as accounts of their own environmentally conscious actions, such as recycling. Our app would bring to light actions that affect the environment in both positive and negative ways in order to foster a more environmentally conscious culture in urban environments
